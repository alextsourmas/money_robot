### MoneyRobot
 
 This code is designed to use DataRobot to predict behaviors in major equities markets in order to make trading decisions. It is not designed for algorithmic trading - it is, however, designed to aid humans in their trading decisions. 

 This is currently a work in progress - soon this file will have full instructions regarding how to run MoneyRobot.
